# Data-Structures
üìö Data Structures Repository
This repository contains my implementations, exercises, and projects from the Data Structures course (course code 202-1-1031) at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.

üîç Course Overview
The course focuses on understanding and implementing abstract data types and their efficient use in algorithm design. We cover both theoretical foundations and practical applications, including algorithm analysis, memory usage, and data manipulation strategies.
